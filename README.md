# docker-wsl

Scripts for managing a simplified `dockerd` on Windows Subsystem for Linux
version 2, without needing Docker Desktop.

An article I wrote on the subject [is available here][article].

## Compatibility

This requires WSL 2. [Microsoft's has step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade to WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-2---update-to-wsl-2).

## Installation

> Warning: before downloading and executing any of these scripts, read over them. I make no claims that they will work or even be safe on your system. You may want to check the function names, for instance, to make sure they do not overwrite vital functions you have already composed. You should also make sure I am not a nefarious individual intent on installing malware on your system or erasing all your files. A little paranoia is in order, as usual.

In general, the instructions for usage are available in comments at the top of each script, and/or in the [article I wrote][article].
